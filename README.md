# My Personal Website

This is the code repo for my personal website found at [andrew-benbow.com](andrew-benbow.com). This website is a fork of [Chirpy](https://github.com/cotes2020/jekyll-theme-chirpy) by Cotes Chung and is hosted on GitHub pages.

## Local Development

I am currently trying to make it so that this repo can be run and developed locally using NixOS. I'll update this section as I get things straightened out.

## Analytics and Comments

I am currently using [Giscus](https://giscus.app/) to power on-site comments and [Goatcounter](goatcounter.com) to power page visits and site analytics. In the spirit of transparency, I have chosen both of these because they are open source and respect people's privacy (they won't track your off-site browsing history, for instance).

Giscus uses github discussions to power comments on posts and requires a free github account in order to leave a comment. This has the added benefit of being easier to moderate than a public comments section.

Goatcounter is a free page view and analytics counter that has the option of making my analytics dashboard public. If you visit [this link to my Goatcounter dashboard](https://oulipiansummer.goatcounter.com/) you will see the same information I see when I review my site traffic. I have chosen to not collect geographic information or language preferences at this time (the existing data on the dashboard is from me testing out the service) in order to respect my visitor's privacy.
