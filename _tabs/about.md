## Andrew Benbow

I'm a custom web developer based in Asheville, North Carolina. I am trained in both front end and back end development for complex, scalable web applications and custom website design.

My primary skill sets include custom software development using Drupal, WordPress, React, Node.Js, and Django.

## What I Do

I have experience building custom software solutions for clients both big and small, private and federal. Below is a quick overview of my main technical skill sets and the technologies I use.

### Drupal <i class="fab fa-drupal"></i>

Drupal CMS (7, 8, 9 & 10) is a fantastic platform for building custom frontend and backend software using Drupal's modular architecture. Many of my largest projects have utilized Drupal because it offers a stable foundation for ultra-precise content management and enterprise software that will last long into the future.

### PHP <i class="fab fa-php"></i>

I use PHP to create reliable, stable, and powerful web experiences using LAMP style servers (Linux, Apache, MySQL, PHP/Perl/Python). As a programming language it is time tested, fast, and as easy to use for beginners as it is for industry experts, making it a great choice for distributed teams with different levels of experience.

### React & Ionic <i class="fab fa-react"></i> 

React is by far my favorite tool for building intuitive and reactive UI's for front end applications. I also have some experience using React to build native applications within the Ionic framework.

### Vanilla JavaScript, TypeScript and JQuery <i class="fab fa-js-square"></i> 

I use modern JavaScript to facilitate interactive web experiences, and I also have experience using TypeScript to turn out full fledged web applications. I occasionally pair this tool with jQuery in order to create fast and intuitive plugins without falling back on an entire UI framework like those offered up by React and Vue or the like.

### HTML & CSS <i class="fab fa-html5"></i> <i class="fab fa-css3-alt"></i>

I have several years of experience using modern HTML and CSS to build accessible, common sense interfaces for both public and private facing web pages. Lately I've taken an interest in standards compliant web development where simple, elegant, declarative languages like HTML and CSS handle the vast majority of frontend work, ensuring a consistent, accessible, and lightweight experience on all devices.

### Python & Django <i class="fab fa-python"></i> 

Along with PHP, I have experience using Python and the Django web framework to build modular websites and web tools. I find that these two are fantastic for quickly standing up an API or simple website that needs the ability to leverage the huge network of libraries and integrations that Python has to offer.

### MYSQL, Maria DB, & PostgreSQL <i class="fas fa-database"></i>

I am experienced using MySQL, MariaDB and PostgreSQL to orchestrate complicated data transformations, performance auditing, and data management on highly sensitive databases.

### Web Hosting & Server Management <i calss="fas fa-server"></i>

Running updates and maintaining code is a crucial aspect of running modern and secure websites. That is why I have training in server management and orchestrating complicated software updates and migrations.
